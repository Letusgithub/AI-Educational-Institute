Backend is in the server folder.
Before uploading courses and anything create the categories e.g. web dev, Python, etc. (without categories courses cannot be added). To create categories create an Admin account and go to dashboard then admin panel.
To create an Admin account first sign up with a student or instructor account then go to your Database under the users model and change that 'accountType' to 'Admin'.
